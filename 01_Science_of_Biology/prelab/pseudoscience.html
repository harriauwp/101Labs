                <h4>Red Flags of Pseudoscience:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anecdotal Evidence:</strong> Relying on personal "success stories" rather than controlled data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Falsifiability:</strong> Making claims that cannot be proven wrong by any possible physical evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Absence of Peer Review:</strong> Pitching ideas directly to the public or media without scientific scrutiny.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static Beliefs:</strong> Refusing to change a claim even when contradictory evidence is presented.</li>
