            <p>A controlled experiment is one in which only one variable is changed at a time, while all others are kept constant. This allows the researcher to determine if the specific variable being tested is responsible for the observed results.</p>

                    <li><strong>Dependent Variable (DV):</strong> The factor you measure or observe (the "effect/data").</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Variables:</strong> Factors kept exactly the same for all groups to prevent "noise" in the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Group:</strong> The baseline group that does not receive the experimental treatment.</li>
