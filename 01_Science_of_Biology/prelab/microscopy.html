            <h2>Micro-Module: The Compound Microscope</h2>
            <p>The compound light microscope is a precision instrument that uses two lens systems (ocular and objective) to magnify small specimens. Proper handling and understanding of its optics are essential for success in the lab.</p>

                <h4>Core Concepts:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Magnification:</strong> Calculated by multiplying the Ocular lens (usually 10X) by the Objective lens (4X, 10X, 40X, or 100X).</li>
                    <li><strong>Inversion:</strong> The microscope optics flip the image both vertically and horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Field of View (FOV):</strong> The visible area seen through the oculars. As magnification increases, the FOV decreases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Field:</strong> The thickness of the specimen that is in sharp focus.</li>

            { 
                prompt: 'If you are using the High-Power (40X) objective lens and a standard 10X ocular lens, what is the total magnification?',
                choices: ['40X', '50X', '400X', '4000X'], 
                answer: 2,
                explain: 'Total Magnification = Ocular (10X) × Objective (40X) = 400X.'
            },
            { 
                prompt: 'Which part of the microscope should you use to adjust the amount of light and the contrast of the specimen?',
                choices: ['Ocular lens', 'Iris diaphragm', 'Coarse focus knob', 'Stage clips'], 
                answer: 1,
                explain: 'The iris diaphragm controls the light cone reaching the specimen, impacting both brightness and contrast.'
            },
            { 
                prompt: 'When moving the slide on the stage to the RIGHT, which way does the image appear to move through the oculars?',
                choices: ['To the right', 'To the left', 'Upward', 'Downward'], 
                answer: 1,
                explain: 'Due to inversion, the image appears to move in the opposite direction of the actual slide movement.'
            },
            { 
                prompt: 'As you switch from the 10X objective to the 40X objective, what happens to the Field of View (FOV)?',
                choices: [
                    'The FOV increases (you see more of the slide)', 
                    'The FOV decreases (you see a smaller, more detailed area)', 
                    'The FOV remains exactly the same'
                ], 
                answer: 1,
                explain: 'Magnification and Field of View are inversely proportional. Higher magnification zooms in on a smaller area.'
            },
            { 
                prompt: 'Which focus knob should ONLY be used when the scanning (4X) objective is in place?',
                choices: ['Fine focus knob', 'Coarse focus knob', 'Mechanical stage knob'], 
                answer: 1,
                explain: 'The coarse focus moves the stage significantly. Using it with high-power objectives can crash the lens into the slide.'
