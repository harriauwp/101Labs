            <h2>Micro-Module: The Process of Science</h2>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Distinguish science from non-science and articulate the iterative steps of the scientific method.</p>
            <p>Science is not just a collection of facts; it is a way of knowing based on evidence, testing, and replication.</p>
