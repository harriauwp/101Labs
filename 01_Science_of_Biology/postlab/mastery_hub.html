                answer: 1,
                explain: 'Total Magnification = Ocular (10X) × Objective (40X) = 400X.'

                prompt: 'In a controlled experiment, which group provides a baseline for comparison?',
                choices: ['The experimental group', 'The independent group', 'The control group', 'The variable group'], 
                answer: 2,
                explain: 'The control group is kept under standard conditions to compare against the experimental changes.'

                answer: 2,
                explain: '1 µm = 1000 nm. 5.2 × 1000 = 5,200.'

                prompt: 'While observing a slide, you notice the image is very "flat" and lacks detail. Which microscope part should you adjust to increase contrast?',
                choices: ['Fine focus knob', 'Iris diaphragm', 'Stage clips', 'Ocular lens'], 
                answer: 1,
                explain: 'The iris diaphragm controls the amount of light and depth of field, which directly affects contrast.'

                answer: 1,
                explain: 'The height is the outcome being measured (the data), making it the dependent variable.'

                    'Use of falsifiable hypotheses'
                ], 
                answer: 0,
                explain: 'Pseudoscience often relies on "it worked for me" stories rather than controlled, replicable data.'

                prompt: 'The width of a field of view at 10X is 2.0 mm. What is the width in micrometers (µm)?',
                choices: ['20 µm', '200 µm', '2,000 µm', '0.002 µm'], 
                answer: 2,
