# 3D Water Molecule Simulation

Welcome to our Physics simulation! This project simulates the interaction and movement of water ($H_2O$) molecules in a 3D space.

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulation (For Students)

*(Note: It may take a minute to load the first time. Be patient!)*

### Instructions
1. Wait for the environment to load.
2. When the file `3DWater.ipynb` opens, click the **double arrow (⏩)** at the top of the screen to run all code cells.
3. Scroll to the bottom to see the 3D animation.

## For Developers
- **Physics Engine**: Calculates intramolecular spring forces and intermolecular Coulomb forces.
- **Visualization**: Generates a 3D animation of the molecules interacting.
